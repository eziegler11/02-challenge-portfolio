# Challenge 02 - Portfolio Page

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

I was inspired to make this portfolio page as a place to capture and share the projects that I am most proud of and that truly reflect my skills. I will use the portfolio page as a way showcase my skills as I develop my career and keep it updated with my latest projects. It will be a seamless way to share my portfolio to anyone that is interested in learning more about my coding skills.
I learned a lot through this project. It really helped me to tie up loose ends when creating my grid in order to make formatting the webpage easier. I also improved on my skills with managing larger blocks of code and keeping them organized.

## Installation

Fork my code through GitHub and you can get started just by using the HTML and CSS files.
